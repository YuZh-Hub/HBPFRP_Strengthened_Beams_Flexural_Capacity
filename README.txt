The three files contained in the folder constitute the original components of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for predicting the flexural capacity of HB-PFRP strengthened RC beams. Among them, file "0. GUI_for_Predict_Flexural_Capacity_of_HB-PFRP_Strengthened_RC_Beams.py" is the source code file, while files "1. Trained_GBDT_model.pkl" and "2. Data_Scaler.pkl" are two dependency files determined based on the source database. The source code operates in the Python 3.9 development environment, where the versions of the dependent packages must be mutually compatible. For reference, the package versions used by the authors are as follows:
Python==3.9.21
Numpy ==1.26.4
